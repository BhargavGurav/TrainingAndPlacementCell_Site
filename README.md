# Training And PlacementCell Site
<h3>This is a Django Application which is helpful for the training and placement cell of any institution.</h3>
<p>It has different sections. It has authentication system. We created three type of user
<ol>
<li>College Admin</li>
<li>Placement Company</li>
<li>Student</li>
</ol>
As they are different type of user they have different controls.
Admin can add mous, reports but other two cannot. Admin can see students list, can operate on the list like sorting 
Or seeing resumes that student has uploaded.

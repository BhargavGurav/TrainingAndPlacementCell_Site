# Training And PlacementCell Site
<h3>This is a Django Application which is helpful for the training and placement cell of any institution.</h3>
<hr>
<p>It has different sections. It has authentication system. We created three type of user
<ol>
<li>College Admin</li>
<li>Placement Company</li>
<li>Student</li>
</ol>
As they are different type of user they have different controls.
Admin can add mous, reports but other two cannot. Admin can see students list, can operate on the list like sorting 
Or seeing resumes that student has uploaded.
Company HR also can see this students details like College Admin but cannot manipulate it. And college student can only see his/her details.
and other updates.
There are two registration forms one for students and other for company HR.(College admin we suppose that it is created only once so it is created while taking over a site.
